I have implemented given task as per given description, I have used bootstrap JS & CSS & HTML5 for responsive site and used core php script to implement it.
- added popup box on " I'm Interested" button and take user info and stored it in mysql DB that copy put in zip as name "geniustest.sql"
- create backend access by adding "/admin" in current directory.
- Admin username : admin
  Paswword: admin
